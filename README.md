This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.9.

This repository hosts a web application built with Angular v18, developed as part of a technical assessment for Factor Energia. The application simulates an administrative dashboard for managing invoices, providing features to view a list of invoices, create new ones, and edit existing ones. Additionally, it allows users to update their profile information.

The application is built entirely with Angular. Data management is implemented using JSON files to provide preloaded lists of translations, users, and invoices. Additionally, local storage is utilized to handle and persist any edited data.

The development leveraged libraries such as [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](fontawesome.com), and [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/). It also incorporated features like pipes, guards, SCSS, and object-oriented programming principles, using interfaces to ensure robust and maintainable code.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
